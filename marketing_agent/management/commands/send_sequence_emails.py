"""
Django management command to send email sequence emails based on delays.

This command should be run periodically (e.g., every 30 minutes via cron) to:
1. Check for contacts that need the next step in their sequence
2. Calculate if the delay time has passed since the previous email
3. Send the next email in the sequence
4. Stop if contact replied or sequence completed

Usage:
    python manage.py send_sequence_emails
    python manage.py send_sequence_emails --dry-run
